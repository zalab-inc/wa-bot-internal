I'll help you understand the README.md file. This is a WhatsApp Sender application with some interesting features. Let me break down the key points:

**Main Features:**
- Automated WhatsApp message sending
- Random message templates
- Random delays between messages
- Automatic retry on failure
- Delivery reports

**Running the App:**
There are several commands available:
- `pnpm dev` - Development mode with auto-reload
- `pnpm start` - Production mode
- `pnpm build` - Build the TypeScript app
- `pnpm serve` - Run the built JavaScript version

**Important Configuration:**
The app can be configured in `src/config/env.ts` with settings like:
- WhatsApp client settings (headless mode, session path)
- Message delays (15-20 seconds between messages)
- Additional delays every 5 messages (20-30 seconds)

**How to Use:**
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
2. Set up recipient numbers in `src/data/recipients.ts`
3. Configure message templates in `src/data/template.ts`
4. Run the app with `pnpm dev`
5. Scan the QR code with WhatsApp on your phone

**Message Sending Flow:**
- Messages are sent sequentially to each number
- Random delay of 15-20 seconds between messages
- Additional 20-30 second delay every 5 messages
- 3 retry attempts if sending fails

**Monitoring & Error Handling:**
- Shows WhatsApp connection status
- Message sending progress
- Delay durations
- Delivery reports (success/failure)
- Phone number format validation
- WhatsApp number verification
- Automatic retries
- Detailed error reporting

**Best Practices:**
1. Use verified WhatsApp numbers
2. Don't set delays too short to avoid blocking
3. Use varied message templates
4. Monitor the sending process

**Troubleshooting:**
- QR code issues: Clear browser sessions and session folder
- Failed sends: Check number format and WhatsApp registration
- Errors: Check logs and restart if needed

Let me help you understand the project structure and technical details from the plan and files.

**Project Overview:**
This is a WhatsApp message sender built with TypeScript and `whatsapp-web.js`.

**Key Technologies:**
- `whatsapp-web.js` - Main WhatsApp API library
- `puppeteer` - Browser automation
- `TypeScript` - Programming language
- `qrcode-terminal` - For QR code display in terminal
- `dotenv` - Environment configuration

**Project Structure:**
```
wa-sender-node/
├── src/
│   ├── config/      - Environment and configuration
│   ├── services/    - WhatsApp service implementation
│   ├── utils/       - Helper functions (validators)
│   ├── data/        - Message templates and recipients
│   └── index.ts     - Main application entry
```

**Core Components:**

1. **WhatsApp Service** (`services/whatsapp.service.ts`):
   - Handles WhatsApp client initialization
   - QR code generation for authentication
   - Message sending functionality
   - Event handling (ready, auth, failures)

2. **Validators** (`utils/validator.ts`):
   - Phone number validation
   - Number formatting (ensuring proper country code)

3. **Environment Config** (`config/env.ts`):
   - Headless mode configuration
   - Session path settings

**Running the Application:**
```bash
pnpm dev    # Development with auto-reload
pnpm start  # Direct TypeScript execution
pnpm build  # Compile to JavaScript
pnpm serve  # Run compiled version
```

**Security Features:**
- Local authentication storage
- Phone number validation
- Secure session management
- Error handling
- Environment variable usage

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Uses Puppeteer for browser automation
- Implements automatic reconnection
- Validates phone numbers before sending
- Supports message templates
- Includes delivery tracking

**Error Handling:**
- Phone number validation
- WhatsApp number existence verification
- Session management
- Connection error handling
- Detailed error logging
